HI WORLD!

I am new as **** , so anyone who could help me to learn programming ?
I heard programmer comunity is helpful.
I am interested on programming as my hobby because it was cool.
I wanted to create something and it lead me to venture into this programming world\
as far as i deep into this new world, i found out this programming stuff was really cool
so again dont be that arrogant not to teach me in fact we could help each other(maybe just me).

IM OUT.
